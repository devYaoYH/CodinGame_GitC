Game Turn

###One game turn is computed as follows:
1)	Move existing troops and bombs
2)	Execute user orders
3)	Produce new cyborgs in all factories
4)	Solve battles
5)	Make the bombs explode
6)	Check end conditions

Game Input

Initialization input
Line 1:factoryCount, the number of factories.
Line 2:linkCount, the number of links between factories.
Next linkCount lines: 3 space-separated integers factory1, factory2 and distance, where distance is the number of turns needed for a troop to travel between factory1 and factory2.

###Input for one game turn
Line 1: an integer entityCount, the number of entities.
Next entityCount lines: an integer entityId, a string entityType and 5 integers arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4 and arg5.

##If entityType equals FACTORY then the arguments are:
arg1: player that owns the factory: 1 for you, -1 for your opponent and 0 if neutral
arg2: number of cyborgs in the factory
arg3: factory production (between 0 and 3)
arg4: number of turns before the factory starts producing again (0 means that the factory produces normally)
arg5: unused

##If entityType equals TROOP then the arguments are:
arg1: player that owns the troop: 1 for you or -1 for your opponent
arg2: identifier of the factory from where the troop leaves
arg3: identifier of the factory targeted by the troop
arg4: number of cyborgs in the troop (positive integer)
arg5: remaining number of turns before the troop arrives (positive integer)

##If entityType equals BOMB then the arguments are:
arg1: player that send the bomb: 1 if it is you, -1 if it is your opponent
arg2: identifier of the factory from where the bomb is launched
arg3: identifier of the targeted factory if it's your bomb, -1 otherwise
arg4: remaining number of turns before the bomb explodes (positive integer) if that's your bomb, -1 otherwise
arg5: unused


###Output for one game turn

The available actions are:
>MOVE source destination cyborgCount: creates a troop of cyborgCount cyborgs at the factory source and sends that troop towards destination. Example: MOVE 2 4 12 will send 12 cyborgs from factory 2 to factory 4.
>BOMB source destination: creates a bomb in the factory source and sends it towards destination.
>INC factory: increases the production of the factory factory at the cost of 10 cyborgs.
>WAIT: does nothing.
>MSG message: prints a message on the screen.
You may use several actions by using a semi-colon ;. Example: MOVE 1 3 18 ; MSG Attack Factory 3. If you try to move more cyborgs that there are in the source factory, then all the available units will be sent.
